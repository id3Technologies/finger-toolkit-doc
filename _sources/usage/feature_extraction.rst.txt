Feature extraction
==================

Feature extraction is the process of extracting unique features from a fingerprint image. It outputs a :ref:`finger template<finger_template>` to be used for :ref:`finger_comparison<finger_comparison>` or :ref:`fingerprint search<finger_search>`.

This component includes several complementary features:

- **Minutia detection** -- This is the core algorithm for fingerprint feature extraction. Minutiae are the most interoperable features and their encoding is precisely defined in ANSI and ISO standards.

- **Minutia encoding** -- Extracts a local signature for each minutia to improve overall matching performance.

- **Finger encoding** -- Extracts a signature of the whole fingerprint to improve the recognition performance. To be used in addition to the minutia detection.

.. hint:: For finger encoding, ensure that the fingerprint image is large enough (above 200x200px at 500dpi) and well captured (correct pose).

.. important:: Finger encoding requires the finger aligner model to be specified.


AI models
=========
The finger extractor component contains the following machine learning models:

Example
=======

The example below demonstrates how to generate a :ref:`FingerTemplate<finger_template_class>` from a :ref:`FingerImage<finger_image_class>`:

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Python
    :sync: Python

    .. literalinclude:: /../samples/sample.py
      :language: python
      :start-after: [feature_extraction]
      :end-before: [feature_extraction]
      :dedent: 4
