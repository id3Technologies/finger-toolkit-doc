Finger template
===============

A finger template is a representation of a fingerprint using the fundamental notion of minutiae and optionally
proprietary information. It is the result of the :ref:`feature extraction<feature_extraction>` process applied to a :ref:`finger image<finger_image>`.

A :ref:`FingerTemplate<finger_template_class>` object contains the following elements:

* Minutia data
* Proprietary fingerprint information such as :ref:`minutia embeddings<minutia_embedding>` and/or :ref:`finger embedding<finger_embedding>`
* Image information

  - Height and width
  - Horizontal and vertical resolution
  - Impression type
  - Position of the finger
  - Image quality

* Capture device information

  - Certification
  - Technology
  - Type identifier (vendor specific)
  - Vendor identifier (registered by IBIA)

It can be stored in a supported standard format for further usage. See :ref:`biometric_standards` for the list of supported formats.

.. note:: 
  Several templates from one or more fingers can be grouped into a single :ref:`finger_template_record_class`.

Minutiae
========
Minutiae are points located at the places in the fingerprint image where friction ridges end or split into two
ridges. Describing a fingerprint in terms of the location and direction of these ridge endings and bifurcations
provides sufficient information to reliably determine whether two fingerprint records are from the same finger.
A typical good-quality fingerprint image contains about 20-70 minutiae points; the actual number depends on
the size of the sensor surface and how the user places his or her finger on the sensor. Each minutia has a
"type" associated with it. There are two major types of minutiae:

- Ridge endings
- Ridge bifurcations

Minutia placement
-----------------
To ensure the best interoperability with other systems, the minutia placement is as follow:

• A minutia on a ridge ending is defined as the valley skeleton bifurcation point.
• A minutia on a ridge bifurcation is defined as the ridge skeleton bifurcation point.

Minutia direction
-----------------
The minutia angle is measured increasing counter-clockwise starting from the horizontal axis to the right. The
angle granularity is 1.40625 (360/256) degrees.

Proprietary information
=======================

.. _minutia_embedding:

Minutia embedding
------------------
A minutia embedding is a local signature representing the neighboorhood of a minutia. It is generated using a deep learning model (see :ref:`ai_models` for details). It is complementary to the positions and angles of the minutiae described above.

Those signatures are stored in the proprietary section of a finger template at a cost of 16 bytes per minutia.

.. _finger_embedding:

Finger embedding
----------------
A finger embedding is a global signature of a fingerprint. It is generated using a deep learning model (see :ref:`ai_models` for details). This
signature contains texture details of the whole fingerprint which is complementary with both the minutiae positions, angles and textures described above.

This signature is stored in the proprietary section of a finger template at a cost of **128 bytes**.

Template quality
================
|product-name| computes a quality for each created template. This value between 0 and 100 aims at predicting
the ability of a template to perform well at matching. A very high template quality means that error rates
during verification will be as low as possible. On the contrary, a low template quality will induce errors during
verification and more precisely false rejections: a genuine person will possibly be rejected by the matching
algorithm because of the poor quality of the presented template. This is why it is important to check template
quality in an enrollment process.
