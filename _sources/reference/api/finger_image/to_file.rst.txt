Module: :ref:`FingerImage<finger_image_class>`

Definition
----------

Saves the image to the specified file.

The compression level meaning depends on the algorithm used:

- For JPEG compression, the value is the expected quality and may vary from 1 to 100.

- For JPEG2000 compression, the value is the compression rate and may vary from 1 to 512.

- For PNG compression, the value is the compression rate and may vary from 1 to 10.

- For all other formats, the value is ignored.
