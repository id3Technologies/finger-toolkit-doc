==================
Fingerprint search
==================

Fingerprint search is the process in which a probe template is searched against the reference templates of more than one subject. It returns a candidate list.

The :ref:`FingerMatcher<finger_matcher_class>` module provides a search method that performs a one-to-many search of a biometric probe against a previously initialized dictionary of biometric references. This method is generally used when the database size is relatively small (up to 1000 templates).

For large databases (over 1000 templates), the :ref:`FingerIndexer<finger_indexer_class>` module offers a more efficient way of performing a one-to-many search. From an index file created from a list of :ref:`finger templates<finger_template_class>`, it uses modern indexing techniques for fast, lossless searching.

Constructing a finger index
===========================

The example below demonstrates how to construct a finger index:

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Python
    :sync: Python

    .. literalinclude:: /../samples/sample.py
      :language: python
      :start-after: [finger_indexer_construction]
      :end-before: [finger_indexer_construction]
      :dedent: 4

Searching in the index
======================

The example below demonstrates how to search for a fingerprint using the index:

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Python
    :sync: Python

    .. literalinclude:: /../samples/sample.py
      :language: python
      :start-after: [finger_indexer_search]
      :end-before: [finger_indexer_search]
      :dedent: 4
