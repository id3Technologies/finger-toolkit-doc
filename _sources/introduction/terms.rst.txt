Terms and Definitions
=====================

For the purpose of this document, the following terms and definitions apply.

    :widths: 30 70

    * - Algorithm
      - A sequence of instructions that tell a biometric system how to solve a particular problem. An algorithm will have a finite number of steps and is typically used by the biometric engine (i.e. the biometric system software) to compute whether a biometric sample and template match. 

    * - Biometric data
      - Data encoding a feature or features used in biometric verification. 

    * - Comparison
      - The process of comparing a biometric sample with a previously stored reference template or templates. 

    * - Comparison score
      - Numerical value resulting from a comparison. 

    * - Enrollment
      - The process of collecting biometric samples from a person and the subsequent preparation and storage of biometric reference templates representing that person's identity. 

    * - Extraction
      - The process of converting a captured biometric sample into biometric data so that it can be compared to a reference template; sometimes called 'characterization'. 

    * - False match
      - Comparison decision of 'match' for a biometric probe and a biometric reference that are from different biometric capture subjects. 

    * - False match rate
      - Expected probability that a captured biometric sample will be falsely declared to match to a single, randomly-selected, non-self biometric reference. 

    * - False non-match
      - Comparison decision of 'non-match' for a biometric probe and a biometric reference that are from the same biometric capture subject and of the same biometric characteristic. 

    * - False non-match rate
      - Proportion of the completed biometric mated comparison trials that result in a false non-match. 

    * - Fingerprint image
      - Area of friction skin on the fleshy surface of a finger located horizontally between the two edges of the fingernail and vertically between the first joint and the tip of a finger. It contains a unique pattern of friction ridge and valley information commonly referred to as a “fingerprint”.

    * - Match / Matching
      - The process of comparing a biometric sample against a previously stored template and scoring the level of similarity. 

    * - Minutiae
      - Friction ridge characteristics that are used to individualize a fingerprint. Minutiae occur at points where a single friction ridge deviates from an uninterrupted flow. Deviation may take the form of ending, bifurcation, or a more complicated “composite” type.

    * - One-to-many search
      - Process in which a biometric probe of one biometric data subject is searched against the biometric references of more than one biometric data subject to return a candidate list or a comparison decision. 

    * - One-to-one comparison
      - Process in which a biometric probe from one biometric data subject is compared to a biometric reference from one biometric data subject to produce a comparison score. 

    * - Template / Reference template
      - | Data, which represents the biometric measurement of an enrollee, used by a biometric system for comparison against subsequently submitted biometric samples.
        | NOTE - this term is not restricted to mean only data used in any particular recognition method, such as template matching. 

    * - Threshold
      - Numerical value (or set of values) at which a decision boundary exists
