Step 3 -- Download the AI models

.. important::
    
    | Models can be downloaded at the following URL: 
    | https://cloud.id3.eu/index.php/s/x3XHygq82oi7BP4 

Since there are lots of models in the folder, it is recommended to download and deploy only the necessary ones for the application.

See :ref:`ai_models` for details.
