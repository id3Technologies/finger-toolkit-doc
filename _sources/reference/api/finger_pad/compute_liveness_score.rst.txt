FingerPad.computeLivenessScore Method
===============================================================================

Module: :ref:`FingerPad<finger_pad_class>`

Definition
----------

Computes a liveness score for a finger image using the loaded model.


.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Python
      :sync: Python

      .. code:: Python

        compute_liveness_score(self, image: FingerImage) -> int

      **Parameters**

        .. line-block::

          ``image`` :ref:`FingerImage<finger_image_class>`
          :guilabel:`in` Source image to process.


      **Returns**

        .. line-block::

          ``int``
          Liveness score. In the range [0:100], 100 meaning that the finger image is very much likely to be live.

      **Exceptions**

        .. line-block::

          :ref:`FingerException<finger_exception>`
          An error has occurred during Finger Library execution.
