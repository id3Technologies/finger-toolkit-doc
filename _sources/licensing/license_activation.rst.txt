.. _license_activation:

==========================
License activation
==========================

The activation of a license is required prior to use any module of this SDK.

License manager (Windows only)
==============================
On windows the graphical License Manager application may also be used to activate licenses. Please refer to the License Manager user's guide for more details.

Please note that on windows, and windows only, you can lock your license on a USB device.

Command-line interface
======================

A command-line activation software is available in the `activation/cli-tool` directory.

For example on linux x64:

.. code-block::

    cd activation/cli-tool/linux/x64
    chmod +x id3LicenseActivationCLI
    ./id3LicenseActivationCLI --help

Several options are possible to activate a license. See :ref:`license_activation_options` for details.

**Activation with a serial number:**

.. code-block::

    id3LicenseActivationCLI.exe --activate .\data\id3Finger.lic --serialkey="XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX"

**Activation with an activation key:**

.. code-block::

    id3LicenseActivationCLI.exe --activate .\data\id3Finger.lic --activationkey="email-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"

**Activation with credentials:**

.. code-block::

    id3LicenseActivationCLI.exe --activate .\data\id3Finger.lic --login="login@domain.com" --password="myPassword" --reference="XXXXXXXX"


Programmatic activation
=======================

It is generally preferred to activate the license programmatically within your application. 
See :ref:`license_handling` in the :ref:`sdk_usage` section for details.

.. note:: On mobile devices, the :ref:`license_hardware_id` is linked to the application itself, so programmatic activation is the only way to activate a license in this case.


.. _license_activation_options:

License activation options
==========================

The following license activation options are available:

- **Serial number**: A unique key in the format ``XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`` allowing a single activation.
- **Activation key**: A unique key in the format ``email-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX`` allowing multiple activations on multiple devices.
- **Credentials**: Customer login/password and reference number of the product to be activated.
 
.. important:: 
    An internet connection is required to complete the activation procedure.
    Unless the ``Online`` option is enabled, once the license is activated, the internet is no longer required.

.. note:: During the activation process, the SDK license is linked to a unique hardware identifier. See :ref:`license_hardware_id` for details.
