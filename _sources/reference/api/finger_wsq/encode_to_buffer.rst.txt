        @staticmethod
        encode_to_buffer(image: FingerImage, bit_rate: float) -> bytearray

      **Parameters**

        .. line-block::

          ``image`` :ref:`FingerImage<finger_image_class>`
          :guilabel:`in` Image to encode to WSQ.

          ``bit_rate`` float
          :guilabel:`in` WSQ encoding bit rate. The lower the bit rate is, the higher is the compression level and vice versa. The recommended bit rate is 0.75. It corresponds to 15:1 compression. Another common bit rate is 2.25 for 5:1 compression.


      **Returns**

        .. line-block::

          ``bytearray``
          Buffer to receive the WSQ encoded image.

      **Exceptions**

        .. line-block::

          :ref:`FingerException<finger_exception>`
          An error has occurred during Finger Library execution.

          :guilabel:`in` Image to encode to WSQ.

          ``bitRate`` double
          :guilabel:`in` WSQ encoding bit rate. The lower the bit rate is, the higher is the compression level and vice versa. The recommended bit rate is 0.75. It corresponds to 15:1 compression. Another common bit rate is 2.25 for 5:1 compression.


      **Returns**

        .. line-block::

          ``Uint8List``
          Buffer to receive the WSQ encoded image.

      **Exceptions**

        .. line-block::

          :ref:`FingerException<finger_exception>`
          An error has occurred during Finger Library execution.
