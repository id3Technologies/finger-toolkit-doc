Fingerprint images
==================

A :ref:`FingerImage<finger_image_class>` contains a fingerprint image and additional data. It includes:

- Raw data
- Image information
  
  - Height and width
  - Horizontal and vertical resolution
  - Impression type
  - Position of the finger
  - Image quality

- Capture device information
 
  - Certification
  - Technology
  - Type identifier (vendor specific)
  - Vendor identifier (registered by IBIA)

A :ref:`FingerImage<finger_image_class>` also provides functionality for loading and storing image files into various formats, including BMP,
JPEG and WSQ (see below).

..note:: Several images from one or more fingers can be grouped into a single :ref:`finger_image_record_class`.

It can be stored in a supported standard format for further usage. See :ref:`image_formats` for the list of supported formats.

Creating a FingerImage
======================
To create a FingerImage, use one of the following methods:

.. list-table:: 
    :width: 100%
    :widths: 30 70
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Method
      - Description

    * - :ref:`fromBuffer<finger_image_from_buffer_class_method>`
      - Creates a FingerImage from a specified data buffer with specified :ref:`image formats<image_formats>`.

    * - :ref:`fromFile<finger_image_from_file_class_method>`
      - Creates a FingerImage from a specified file with specified :ref:`image formats<image_formats>`.

    * - :ref:`fromRawBuffer<finger_image_from_raw_buffer_class_method>`
      - Creates a FingerImage from a specified data buffer containing the raw image data (8-bit grayscale).

Saving a FingerImage to a file
==============================
To save a FingerImage to a file in one of the supported :ref:`image formats<image_formats>`, proceed as follow:

- call the :ref:`finger_image_to_file_class_method`.

If standardized biometric data interchange format is needed (ISO/IEC 19794-4 or ANSI INCITS-381), proceed as follow:

- create a :ref:`FingerImageRecord<finger_image_record_class>`,
- add the :ref:`FingerImage<finger_image_class>` to the record,
- save the record to a file in the required format.

Managing multiple fingeprints of the same user
==============================================
A :ref:`FingerImageRecord<finger_image_record_class>` objects provides functionalities for loading and storing the information from one or more finger
image areas using standardized biometric data interchange formats. This can be used for the exchange and comparison
of finger image data.

Each image record shall belong to a single subject.
