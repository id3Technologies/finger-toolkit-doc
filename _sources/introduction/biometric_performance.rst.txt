Factors affecting biometric accuracy
====================================

The overall accuracy of a fingerprint recognition system may vary according to a number of factors such as:

- Quality of the sensor,
- Quality of the fingerprint pose,
- Skin condition (dry, wet, scars),
- Population under test.
- etc.

Performance metrics
===================

False non match rate (FNMR) is the proportion of mated comparisons below a threshold set to achieve the
false match rate (FMR) specified. FMR is the proportion of impostor comparisons at or above that threshold.
Since FMR and FNMR is in inverse proportion to each other, choosing the operational threshold is a trade-off
between system security and user convenience.

NIST MINEX III evaluation
=========================

The MINEX III was initiated by the National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST). It aims at measuring
the performance of automated fingerprint recognition technologies using minutiae data only for interoperability
among vendors.

Datasets
--------
As stated in `MINEX III test plan <https://github.com/usnistgov/minex/blob/master/minexiii/testplan.pdf>`_:

*ยง3.2. Resolution and dimensions*

"All images for this test will employ 500 pixels per inch resolution (horizontal and vertical). The dimensions of
the fingerprint images will vary from 150-812 pixels in width, and 166-1000 pixels in height."

*ยง3.3. Sensor and impression types*

"All images used for testing in MINEX III [...] have been obtained from live-scan sensors (Smiths-Heimann
ACCO 1394 and Cross Match 300A). All images tested in MINEX III are plain impression type images."

Results
-------
The overall ranking can be found here: `<https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/minutiae-interoperability-exchange-minex-iii>`_.

The latest reports of the MINEX III for id3 algorithms can be found `here <https://pages.nist.gov/minex/results/reportcards/pdf/minexiii/id3+13B1_generator_report.pdf and https://pages.nist.gov/minex/results/reportcards/pdf/minexiii/id3+13B1_matcher_report.pdf>`_.

The finger minutia detector 3B of this SDK corresponds to the template generator of the *id3_13B1* submission.
The finger minutia matcher of this SDK corresponds to the template matcher of the *id3_13B1* submission.


Internal evaluation
======================

To help the id3 Finger SDK user to choose what data to extract from a fingerprint depending on its use case,
we evaluate the various possible fusions on some public datasets.

Datasets
--------
We evaluate internally our algorithms on the FVC datasets (2000, 2002 and 2004). More details can be found at the following URLs:

- `<http://bias.csr.unibo.it/fvc2000/databases.asp>`_
- `<http://bias.csr.unibo.it/fvc2002/databases.asp>`_

The following graph presents the various possible combinations of match fusions using id3 Finger SDK.

.. hint:: 
    - In the context of interoperability, use minutiae only.
    - In the context of a "small" sensor (under 200x200px at 500dpi), use minutiae and minutia embeddings.
    - In the context of a large sensor (above 200x200px at 500dpi), use minutiae, minutia embeddings and finger embedding.
