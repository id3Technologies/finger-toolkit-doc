|product-name| offers the following features and benefits:

- Highly accurate and interoperable minutiae detection algorithm
- Fast and accurate one-to-one comparison and one-to-many search
- Full standards support of biometric data interchange formats (ISO/ANSI)
- FBI-certified implementation of the Wavelet Scalar Quantization (WSQ) compression algorithm
- Implementation of the NIST NFIQ algorithm for image quality analysis

id3’s algorithms have been extensively tested by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
in one of the industry’s most reliable, rigorous and statistically significant tests of performance and interoperability
of core fingerprint algorithms (MINEX). Specifically, id3’s template generator has demonstrated top-level
accuracy, outperforming most of the well-known biometric market leaders. In combination with smart cards
implementing fingerprint match-on-card technology, the overall infrastructure delivers the required security and
privacy for the deployment of a secure, interoperable and flexible solution.
