Fingerprint comparison
======================

Fingerprint comparison is the process of comparing a finger template against a previously stored reference template.

Since a finger template can contain 3 types of data (minutiae, minutia embeddings and/or finger embedding), the matching process adapts to the content of the reference and probe templates, and uses all data that is present in both the reference and probe templates.

Minutia-only matching can still be forced for interoperability purposes, if required.

.. note:: 
  A :ref:`FingerTemplateRecord<finger_template_record_class>` should contain templates from a single user.


Threshold and decision
======================
The decision is the result of the comparison between the biometric comparison similarity score of given biometric data and a predefined threshold to achieve the desired security level. If the score is greater than the predefined minimal matching score threshold, the biometric verification is successful.

A decision threshold applied on the algorithm output score determines the operational FMR (False Match Rate), i.e. the probability of a system to falsely accept fingerprints (impostors). Since FMR and FNMR (False Non-Match Rate) are in inverse proportion to each other, FNMR will increase with higher decision thresholds.

Choosing the operational threshold is a trade-off between system security and user convenience. In one-to-one comparison mode, the operational threshold should be determined from the table below:

.. list-table:: 
  :width: 100%
  :widths: 30 70
  :header-rows: 1

  * - False Match Rate
    - Decision threshold
  * - 1.0%
    - 2000
  * - 0.1%
    - 3000
  * - 0.01%
    - 4000
  * - 0.001%
    - 5000
  * - 0.0001%
    - 6000
  * - 0.00001%
    - 7000
  * - 0.000001%
    - 8000
  * - 0.000001%
    - 9000
  * - 0.0000001%
    - 10000

Performing a one-to-one comparison
==================================

The :ref:`FingerMatcher<finger_matcher_class>` module provides methods for comparing two :ref:`finger templates<finger_template_class>` or two :ref:`finger template records<finger_template_record_class>`. The methods return a comparison score, from 0 to 65535 representing the degree of similarity between the two templates.

.. hint::
  To obtain a value between 0 and 100, we recommend applying the following formula to the matching score (**S**):
  
  :math:`S' = MIN(100, S * 8 / 250)`

Matching details
----------------

In the fingerprint comparison context it can be useful to know which minutiae were used by the matcher to
output a "match" decision. Therefore id3 Finger SDK provides an optional component that contains the list of
matched minutiae. See :ref:`finger_matcher_compare_templates_in_details_class_method` for more information.


Example
=======

The example below demonstrates how to compare two fingerprints:

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Python
    :sync: Python

    .. literalinclude:: /../samples/sample.py
      :language: python
      :start-after: [finger_comparison]
      :end-before: [finger_comparison]
      :dedent: 4
